# Module 2 | Week 4 | Lesson 9
**Description**
Work with a partner to implement the following user stories:

* As a user, I want to easily choose a skill from a list to use in the form.

* As a user, I want to easily select a date from a datepicker instead of writing it out manually.

## Instructions
1. Watch [the video associated with this lesson.]()
2. It's done when the form input for entering a skill has an autocomplete feature added to it, to pick from a list of skills.
3. It's done when the form input for entering a date has a datepicker feature added to it, to select by month and year.
4. BONUS: What built-in HTML feature can also help enforce a date?

## Hints

* You will need to add an array of skills to use with the autocomplete widget (for example, `JavaScript`, `Node.js`, `Bootstrap`, `React`, and `CSS`). 

* Look for "Display month & year menus" in the list of examples on the datepicker widget page of the jQuery UI docs.

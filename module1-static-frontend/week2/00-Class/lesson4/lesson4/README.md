# Week 2: Lesson 4
**Description**: In this lesson, we're going to practice fixing accessibility problems in HTML code.

**Instructions**: 

1. Watch the [introduction video for Lesson 2]() and follow along with the instructor.
2. Open the index.html file in this folder in your browser. Turn on Narrator (Windows) or VoiceOver (Mac) by holding the Windows Key + ctrl + enter on a PC and cmd + F5 on Mac. Listen to the narration and try tabbing through the elements. You'll notice problems.
3. Use what you learned in this lesson to fix the accessibility problems.
4. You've succeeded when the screen reader tells you a description of the image, tells you the name of the a tags, and tells you a name for the magnifying glass icon.
4. BONUS: Surf the web and find a site with really bad accessibility. Share it with the class.

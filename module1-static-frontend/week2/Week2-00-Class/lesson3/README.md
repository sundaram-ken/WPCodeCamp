# Week 2: Lesson 3
**Description**: We are going to build a form that will get a pic of a cute kitty at a size of your choosing.

**Instructions**
1. Watch the [introduction video for Lesson 2]() and follow along with the instructor
2. Open the index.html file in this folder in your browser. Try entering a number into the text field in the form and hitting the submit button. The browser will refresh, but will otherwise do nothing.
3. Notice the URL in the commented code above the form. Complete the form so that it successfully sends its get request to a URL that resembles the one in the comment.
4. You've succeeded if you enter a number in the form field and hit submit and a cat pic appears on the screen at the width you put into your form.
4. BONUS: Visit [the API's website](https://cataas.com/) and try to make the form retrieve another custom image based on different input.

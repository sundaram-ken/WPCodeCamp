              <p class="biotext white-bg">I'm a Web Systems Administrator working for an Austin based 
                 web development company, with whom I've been employed since
                 2013 when I was accepted as an intern.  A majority of my
                 work involves bulding and managing web and development servers
                 for ourself and many of our clients, troubleshooting and 
                 repairing broken websites, and managing the maintenance of 
                 those wesites, and minor development work.  Ever since taking
                 a rudimentary computer programming class in junior high, I've
                 been fascinated with computers and IT in general, and almost 
                 the entirety of my knowledge and skillset was earned through 
                 self-taught means.  I came to Austin from Dallas in 2006 
                 after working various jobs before deciding to try and get a 
                 job in the IT field.  In addition, I've served six years, both
                 at home and abroad, as an M1A1 and M1A2 tank crewmember in the    
                 United States Army.  I'm married, have two kids and three 
                 dogs. I love to cook, watch movies and spend time with my 
                 family, and my hobbies consist of lockpicking, practicing 
                 marksmanship, and DJing.</p>
